TASKS COMPLETED:


[DONE] The client wants users. Add user registration and login. There should be an admin user who will have access to the admin console.

[DONE] Rails has_secure_password (bcrypt) is sufficient for the auth.

[DONE] Turns out HTTP Basic Authentication has some flaws. Replace it with session based authentication and authorization with a Users table.

[DONE] Products should be classified into categories. A product can have many categories and a category can have many products. On the home page, have a link that shows all the categories available for selection. When a particular category is clicked, show all products that have that category.

[DONE] A productâ€™s show page should show which categories the product is in

[DONE] Update the tests for categories and for your new authentication scheme.
